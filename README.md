# Notes on C++ Programming

These are personal notes on the **C++ programming language**.
They are based on the course "Elementi di programmazione per la fisica", held at the University of Bologna during the 2014/2015 academic year.

These notes are also partly inspired by "C++ Commedia", authored by Prof. Graziano Servizi.

## Notes on the Standard

At the time these notes were created, the default C++ standard was C++11. As such, most of the content is based on that version of the language.

However, I have included references to more recent standards, in particular C++17 and C++20, and have also added brief comments on upcoming features introduced in C++23 and C++26.
