#+title: Struct
* Structs
The idea is to put together difefrent types into a single type. It is very similar to the class object.
This is the module where the struct is defined (see [[file:modules.org][modules]]).

#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :results output :exports both :flags "-std=c++23" :cmdline "-o prog" :classname main
export module employee;

export struct Employee {
  char firstInitial;
  char lastInitial;
  int employeeNumber;
  int salary;
};
#+END_SRC

In the code I can then define a variable called "anEmployee" of type "Employee".
This will carry all infos that I put in teh struct

#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :results output :exports both :flags "-std=c++23" :cmdline "-o prog" :classname main
import employee; //This imports the module
using namespace std;

int main()
{
// Create and populate an employee.
//This variable contains infos about all attributes to the type: firstInitial,lastInitial,emplyeeN,salary
Employee anEmployee;

//Note the . operator to access the fields of the struct
anEmployee.firstInitial = 'J';
anEmployee.lastInitial = 'D';
anEmployee.employeeNumber = 42;
anEmployee.salary = 80000;


// Output the values of an employee.
println("Employee: {}{}", anEmployee.firstInitial,
anEmployee.lastInitial);
println("Number: {}", anEmployee.employeeNumber);
println("Salary: ${}", anEmployee.salary);
}
#+END_SRC
