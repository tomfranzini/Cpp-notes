#+title: Modules
* Modules
They have the .cpp extension.
Two things are needed at the beginning of a module
- a /Module declaration/: this describes what is in teh module
- what the file has to /export/, i.e. what will be visible when the file is imported somewhere else.
  This is done by adding the word *export*

  #+BEGIN_SRC C++ :results output :exports both :flags "-std=c++23" :cmdline "-o prog" :classname main
export module employee;

export struct Employee {
  char firstInitial;
  char lastInitial;
  int employeeNumber;
  int salary;
};
#+END_SRC
