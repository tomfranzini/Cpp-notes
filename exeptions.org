#+title: Exeptions
* Exceptions
They are used to add some safety mesures in the code.
An exeption is a situation _you want to avoid in code_.

For example imagine you call a function and for some reason it is not able to do whatever it has to do.
In this case you would return a nullptr or an error message.
Exceptions are used to deal with this situations in a better way.

The idea is teh following
- the compiler detects a particular situationa and /throw/ an exception
- anotehr piece of code /catch/ the exeption and do something appropriate

Here is an example
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ :results output :exports both :flags "-std=c++23" :cmdline "-o prog" :classname main
#include <iostream>
#include<print>
using namespace std;

double divide (double numerator, double denominator){
    if (denominator == 0) throw invalid_argument {"Denominator cannot be 0."};
    return numerator/denominator;
}

int main(){
    println{"Division is {}", divide(3.0,4.0)};
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Here the exeption that is thrown is /invalid_argument/ which is in <stdexept>.
